        <p class="title">STAR WARS<br>SCROLL EFFECT<br>by Steven Kay<br></p>
        <p>This was done using plain CSS.</p>
        <p>The tilt was done using 3D CSS transform (rotate X by 35 degrees). It uses viewport units so should work at any resolution.</p>
        <p>Note how the text fades out as it reaches the top. This is done by overlaying a custom gradient from black(0%) to transparent(50%) using a high z-index to place it above the text.</p>
        <p>The animation uses @keyframe to change the top position in a linear fashion from 35rem to -85rem; the moves the text gradually up the screen, while the camera stays in the same place.<p/>
        <p>There's also a very subtle glow effect added using text-shadow.</p>
        <p>Works in FF, Chrome and Safari (but Safari is painfully slow)</p>
